The Backend application for Moneta®

Moneta® is a platform for coin collectors, enthusiasts, and numsmatists. 
Our users are able to create and post blogs related to the topics of Numismatics, Monetary History, and current Coin News.
With this revolutionary platform, our users will be able to share valuable information with other users
as well as being able to buy, sell, or display their coin and currency collections.

"Moneta" stands for "Coin" in several languages such as Russian and Italian. Our founder, Ben Von Achen, was inspired by the idea for Moneta® for his love
for the hobby. From a very young age, Ben was intrigued by the Study of Numismatics and Monetary History. 
He loves and appreciates the art of coins and currency. He also worked for several coin dealers, buying and selling 
precious metals and rare coins and currency.

The Study of Numismatics in a sense has become a lost art, which is why we need to bring to light in the great digital era.
At Moneta® we want to make Numismatics Great Again by bringing it into the digital frontier.
